      <link>http://localhost:1313/events/20231026-nsa/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 14:00:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A real-world challenge in data science is to develop interactive methods for quickly analyzing new and novel data sets that are potentially of massive scale. In this talk, Bader will discuss his development of graph algorithms in the context of Arkouda, an open-source NumPy-like replacement for interactive data science on tens of terabytes of data. Massive-scale analytics is an emerging field that integrates the power of high-performance computing and mathematical modeling to extract key insights and information from large-scale data sets. Productivity in massive-scale analytics entails quick interpretation of results through easy-to-use frameworks, while also adhering to design principles that combine high-performance computing and user-friendly simplicity. However, data scientists often encounter challenges, especially with graph analytics, which require the analysis of complex data from various domains, such as the cybersecurity, natural and social sciences. To address this issue, we introduce Arachne, an open-source framework that enhances accessibility and usability in massive-scale graph analytics. Arachne offers novel algorithms and implementations of graph kernels for efficient data analysis, such as connected components, breadth-first search, triangle counting, k-truss, among others. The high-performance algorithms are integrated into a back-end server written in HPE/Cray&amp;rsquo;s Chapel language and can be accessed through a Python application programming interface (API).  Arachne&amp;rsquo;s back-end server is compatible with Linux supercomputers, is easy to set up, and can be utilized through either Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks, which makes it a desirable tool for data scientists who have access to high performance computers. In this talk, Bader presents an overview of the algorithms his research group has implemented into Arachne and, if applicable, the algorithmic innovations of each. Further, Bader will discuss improvements to our graph data structure to store extra information such as node labels, edge relationships, and node and edge properties. Arachne is built as an extension to the open-source Arkouda framework and allows for graphs to be generated from Arkouda dataframes. The open-source code for Arachne can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit&lt;/a&gt;. This is joint work with Oliver Alvarado Rodriguez, Zhihui Du, Joseph Patchett, Naren Khatwani, Fuhuan Li,  Bader is supported in part by the National Science Foundation award CCF-2109988.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging real-world graph problems include: detecting and preventing disease in human populations; revealing community structure in large social networks; protecting our elections from cyber-threats; and improving the resilience of the electric power grid. Unlike traditional applications in computational science and engineering, solving these problems at scale often raises new challenges because of the sparsity and lack of locality in the data, the need for additional research on scalable algorithms and development of frameworks for solving these problems on high performance computers, and the need for improved models that also capture the noise and bias inherent in the torrential data streams. In this talk, Bader will discuss the opportunities and challenges in massive data-intensive computing for applications in computational science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science aims to solve grand global challenges such as: detecting and preventing disease in human populations; revealing community structure in large social networks; protecting our elections from cyber-threats, and improving the resilience of the electric power grid. Unlike traditional applications in computational science and engineering, solving these social problems at scale often raises new challenges because of the sparsity and lack of locality in the data, the need for research on scalable algorithms and architectures, and development of frameworks for solving these real-world problems on high performance computers, and for improved models that capture the noise and bias inherent in the torrential data streams. In this talk, Bader will discuss the opportunities and challenges in massive data science for applications in social sciences, physical sciences, and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supercomputers enable us to tackle some of the most challenging computational and data-intensive real-world problems facing our societies and the planet. In this talk, David A. Bader, the 2021 IEEE Computer Society Sidney Fernbach Award recipient, will share his passion for solving these global grand challenges. Bader revolutionized the computing industry by architecting the first Linux Supercomputer. Today, all the Top 500 supercomputers in the world are Linux HPC systems. His seminal contributions include the first general-purpose programming methodology for multicore clusters and accelerator technologies, such as his pioneering use of the Cell processor and GPUs. Bader is also recognized for his long-standing research efforts on novel parallel and streaming algorithms that have produced multiple “firsts” for graph traversal, search, centrality, and community detection, and many of the best-performing graph algorithms for GPUs. Bader is an innovator in academia as well. In 2005, Bader founded Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech, created MS and PhD academic programs, and launched a successful new school. In 2019, Bader moved to New Jersey Institute of Technology as inaugural director of the Institute of Data Science, founded the Department of Data Science, and created one of the first B.S. degrees in Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NJBDA Talk: Large-Scale Graph Analytics in Arkouda</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/events/20210430-njbda/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Exploratory graph analytics is a much sought out approach to help extract useful information from graphs. One of its main challenges arises when the size of the graph expands outside of the memory capacity that a typical computer can handle. Solutions must then be developed to allow data scientists to efficiently handle and analyze large graphs in a short period of time, using machines that have the capacity to handle massive file sizes. Arkouda is a software package under early development created with the intent to bridge the gap between massive parallel computations and data scientists wishing to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). The communication system between the Chapel back-end and the Python front-end helps to create an easy-to-use interface for data scientists that does not require knowledge of the underlying Chapel code and instead allows them to utilize the simple Python front-end to carry out all their large file and graph EDA needs. In this work, a graph data structure is designed and implemented into the Arkouda framework at both the Chapel back-end and the Python front-end. The main attraction of this data structure is its ability to occupy less memory space and perform efficient adjacency edge searching. A parallel breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is also presented to help demonstrate how easily one can implement parallel algorithms in Arkouda to increase EDA productivity with graphs. Lastly, real-world graphs from different domains, such as biology and social networks, are utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the graph data structure and the BFS algorithm. The results obtained from this benchmarking help show that the Arkouda overhead is almost negligible, and data scientists can utilize Arkouda for large scale graph analytics. This work can help further bridge the gap between high-performance computing (HPC) software and data science to create a framework that is straightforward for all data scientists to use. All of the code in this project and in Arkouda is open source and can be found on GitHub. This is joint work with Mike Merrill and William Reus. We acknowledge the support of National Science Foundation grant award CCF- 2109988.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Title&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Solving Global Grand Challenges with High Performance Data Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract&lt;/em&gt;: Data science aims to solve grand global challenges such as: detecting and preventing disease in human populations; revealing community structure in large social networks; protecting our elections from cyber-threats, and improving the resilience of the electric power grid. Unlike traditional applications in computational science and engineering, solving these social problems at scale often raises new challenges because of the sparsity and lack of locality in the data, the need for research on scalable algorithms and architectures, and development of frameworks for solving these real-world problems on high performance computers, and for improved models that capture the noise and bias inherent in the torrential data streams. In this talk, Bader will discuss the opportunities and challenges in massive data science for applications in social sciences, physical sciences, and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Government agencies across the globe are challenged with complex, ever-evolving problems. The answers exist somewhere in a vast amount of data, but they are only identifiable with the right technology to make sense of the interconnectedness within your data. That technology is a graph database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This online event is a full day of thought leadership on graphs in government, featuring speakers from &lt;strong&gt;New Jersey Institute of Technology&lt;/strong&gt;, Northrop Grumman and Turku City Data, as well as Neo4j experts like our Chief Scientist, Jim Webber.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/events/20170301-siam-cse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This forward-looking panel will explore the future of CSE in a broad academic context. What new &amp;ldquo;grand challenges&amp;rdquo; may drive progress in CSE? How can CSE shape the future of new application fields such as computational medicine and biology, computational geoscience, and materials science? Are there opportunities to extend CSE to new areas such as social network analysis, cybersecurity and the social sciences, with mathematics-based large-scale computing rapidly becoming of crucial importance in almost all areas of society? Is the CSE paradigm and focus sufficiently unique and significant to warrant separate programs, graduate degrees, academic departments, and funding streams?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CLSAC 2016 Invited Talk: Massive-Scale Streaming Analytics</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/events/20161025-clsac/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2016 16:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/events/20161025-clsac/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Building on last year’s theme of Productive Analytics, the fifth CLSAC workshop will address the need for large-scale streaming analytics in the operation and management of complex systems.  Driverless cars, robots, early-warning systems, and exascale computers, to name but a few, will require the analysis of multiple streams of data in real-time.   The volume, velocity, and variety of real-time, data streams pose unique hardware and software challenges different from those faced when analyzing volumes of available data. Hardware will need to provide sufficient computing, memory, communication, and error detection capabilities to meet hard deadlines. Runtime systems will have to be self-aware rescheduling for high-priority events and recovering from faults all within strict a power limit. Scalable, resilient algorithms capable of returning actionable decisions, steering computations, and classifying events must be developed. Finally, software platforms and tools useable by subject matter experts are essential to lower the cost of entry.
​
The workshop’s goals are to bring together thought leaders across government, industry, and academia to discuss key challenges for streaming analytics.  Important questions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the scientific, government and commercial application drivers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the requirements imposed by the volume, velocity and variety of data at ingest?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are hardware requirements for processing at scale to meet hard deadlines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can data errors be discovered and fixed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can faulty hardware be detected and circumvented?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the basic analytics methods and what classes of problems to they address?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there a set of security best-practices to protect complex systems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can platforms be made simple to use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we enable computation across the entire network enterprise (from the sensor to the data center)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we deal with non-technical and policy constraints (legal, privacy and ownership)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms, introduced over 30 years ago, had a transformative effect on software for linear algebra. With the BLAS, researchers spend less time mapping algorithms onto specific features of hardware platforms and more time on interesting new algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would it be practical to define an analogous set of basic building blocks for graph algorithms?  Can we define a core set of mathematical primitives from which we can build most (if not all) important graph algorithms? If we can agree on the mathematical foundations, how would these interact with the data structures used in graph algorithms and result in an API the graph algorithms research community could support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions will be the topic for the third “Graph Algorithms Building Blocks” workshop.  Our goal is an interactive workshop where the full range of issues behind “Graph Algorithms Building Blocks” will be explored.   We want an interactive “workshop” so papers that report preliminary results and unproven but interesting ideas will be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NITRD 2015 Invited Panelist: Supercomputing and Big Data: From Collision to Convergence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/events/20151118-nitrd/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2015 10:30:00 -0600</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;supercomputing-and-big-data-from-collision-to-convergence&#34;&gt;Supercomputing and Big Data: From Collision to Convergence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As data intensive science emerges, the need for high performance computing (HPC) to converge capacity and capabilities with Big Data becomes more apparent and urgent. Capacity requirements have stemmed from science data processing and the creation of large scale data products (e.g., earth observations, Large Hadron Collider, square-kilometer array antenna) and simulation model output (e.g., flight mission plans, weather and climate models). Capacity growth is further amplified by the need for more rapidly ingesting, analyzing, and visualizing voluminous data to improve understanding of known physical processes, discover new phenomena, and compare results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does HPC need to change in order to meet these Big Data needs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can HPC and Big Data communities learn from each other?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What impact will this have on conventional workflows, architectures, and tools?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An invited international panel of experts will examine these disruptive technologies and consider their long-term impacts and research directions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging real-world graph problems include detecting community structure in large social networks, improving the resilience of the electric power grid, and detecting and preventing disease in human populations. Unlike traditional applications in computational science and engineering, solving these problems at scale often raises new challenges because of sparsity and the lack of locality in the data, the need for additional research on scalable algorithms and development of frameworks for solving these problems on high performance computers, and the need for improved models that also capture the noise and bias inherent in the torrential data streams. In this talk, the speaker will discuss the opportunities and challenges in massive data-intensive computing for applications in computational biology, genomics, and security. The explosion of real-world graph data poses a substantial challenge: How can we analyze constantly changing graphs with billions of vertices? Our approach leverages fine-grained parallelism, lightweight synchronization, and shared memory, to scale to massive graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;aims-of-the-conference&#34;&gt;AIMS OF THE CONFERENCE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are experiencing a revolution in the capacity to quickly collect
and transport large amounts of data. Not only has this revolution
changed the means by which we store and access this data, but has also
caused a fundamental transformation in the methods and algorithms that
we use to extract knowledge from data. In scientific fields as diverse
as climatology, medical science, astrophysics, particle physics,
computer vision, and computational finance, massive streaming data
sets have sparked innovation in methodologies for knowledge discovery
in data streams. Cutting-edge methodology for streaming data has come
from a number of diverse directions, from on-line learning, randomized
linear algebra and approximate methods, to distributed optimization
methodology for cloud computing, to multi-class classification
problems in the presence of noisy and spurious data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conference will bring together researchers from applied
mathematics and several diverse scientific fields to discuss the
current state of the art and open research questions in streaming data
and real-time machine learning. The conference will be domain driven,
with talks focusing on well-defined areas of application and
describing the techniques and algorithms necessary to address the
current and future challenges in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sessions will be accessible to a broad audience and will have a single
track format with additional rooms for breakout sessions and posters.
There will be no formal conference proceedings, but conference
applicants are encouraged to submit an abstract and present a talk
and/or poster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether petascale computing can be sustained into the future; or whether power, space, and cost will restrict the number of sites around the world is the central question for SOS11.  The SOS series of workshops aims to assemble interdisciplinary teams and collaboratories to develop the required, state-of-the-art mathematical algorithms and software, supported by appropriate hardware and middleware infrastructure to use petascale (and beyond) computing resources effectively to advance fundamental research in compelling scientific missions.  The overarching goal of the first SOS meeting was to familiarize all participants with the overall integrated SOS program and to initiate team building both across DOE laboratories and with academia to support that integration across projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme is &amp;ldquo;Challenges of Sustained Petascale Computation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;workshop-on-building-scalable-simulations-of-complex-socio-technical-systems&#34;&gt;Workshop on Building Scalable Simulations of Complex Socio-Technical Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex socio-technical systems consist of a large number of
interacting physical, technological, and human/societal
components. Examples of such systems are urban regional transportation
systems, national electrical powermarkets and grids, the Internet,
ad-hoc communication and computing systems, public health,
etc. Realistic social and infrastructure networks spanning urban
regions are extremely large: consisting of millions of nodes and
edges. As a result, the detailed simulations capable of representing
such systems consist of millions of interacting agents. The challenges
pertaining to design and implementations of such simulations on high
performance computing platforms are unique, e.g., computation of
extremely large dynamic unstructured composed networks. The workshop
aims to bring together some of the leading researchers with the goal
of identifying fundamental issues in designing, implementing and using
such simulations on current and next generation high performance
computing architectures. Examples of topics that will be covered
include scalable HPC oriented design of such simulations; distributed
algorithms and their implementations; formal specifications and
simulation specific HPC system software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SC02 Panelist: Computational Biology and High Performance Computing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/events/20021119-sc02/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2002 13:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/events/20021119-sc02/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moderator: Craig Stewart, Indiana University&lt;br&gt;
Panelists: Chris Johnson (Utah); John Reynders (Celera); &lt;strong&gt;David Bader&lt;/strong&gt; (New Mexico); Debra Goldfarb (IDC); Rick Stevens (Argonne National Laboratories and the University of Chicago)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biological/biomedical/bioinformatic/genomic/proteomic sciences now require the use of massive high performance computing (HPC) resources. In fact, biological sciences may more than double the size of the HPC market according to some estimates. This panel will be drawn primarily from the user community - people whose background is in the biological or chemical sciences - who have been successful in implementing HPC solutions to current biological and biomedical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions to be addressed by this panel include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What has been the nature of the problems and the HPC solutions when HPC technologies have been critical to the solution of important problems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the current best practices in use of HPC in biological/biomedical sciences?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where has use of HPC approaches not yet been helpful in solving biological problems, and why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the big future problems in the biological sciences that will require use of HPC systems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the biological research community need from the HPC community in order to foster better and more rapid implementation of HPC solutions to biological problems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What hardware architectures are most effective now, and what will the most effective hardware architectures be in 5 years?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the software frameworks and applications that most effectively facilitate solution of important biological and biomedical problems?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David A. Bader&lt;/strong&gt; is an Assistant Professor of Electrical &amp;amp; Computer Engineering at The University of New Mexico, and received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 1996 from The University of Maryland. David&amp;rsquo;s recent research experiences highlight his ability to bridge the gap between application and computer science. For example, while an NSF CISE Postdoctoral Research Associate in Experimental Computer Science, David worked closely with Earth scientists at NASA/GSFC and University of Maryland&amp;rsquo;s Geography Department to develop a high-performance system for on-demand queries of terascale remotely-sensed Earth science data, such as 4km AVHRR global coverage, used for monitoring long-term global studies of the Earth. In addition to developing some of the fastest known portable, high-performance algorithms for image segmentation and classification applications, combinatorial problems such as sorting and selection, and data communication primitives, David&amp;rsquo;s recent research has produced a new, preliminary methodology for programming UMA shared-memory machines and clusters of SMP nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IEEE Outstanding Young Engineering Award Talk, Cosponsored by the Electrical &amp;amp; Computer Engineering Department&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Bader&lt;/strong&gt; is an Assistant Professor of EECE at the University of New Mexico (UNM).  He will review recent new engineering developments in parallel computing algorithms and parallel computers which may break the bottleneck of sequential computing for practical applications that require complex combinatorial optimization. He will demonstrate this ability to brdge this gap using problems such as aligning sequences and reconstructing evolutionary trees that arise in computational genomics and bioinformatics. David&amp;rsquo;s recent research has produced a new, preliminary methodology for programming shared-memory machines and clusters of nodes. David is considered a &amp;ldquo;Mega Star&amp;rdquo; in EECE Dept., ranking in top 2 faculty, in funding, among all CE faculty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Science &amp;amp; Society Series of Talks is co-sponsored by the Sigma Xi Headquarters, the Office of the Associate Provost for Research, the Office of the Vice President for Health Sciences, the Colleges of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences, Education, Engineering, and Pharmacy, the Center for Radioactive Waste Management, the University Honors Program, the Department of Physics &amp;amp; Astronomy, the Divsion of Continuing Education, and the Albuquerque Section of the Institute of Electrical &amp;amp; Electronics Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;speaker-biography&#34;&gt;Speaker Biography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David A. Bader&lt;/strong&gt; is an Assistant Professor of Electrical &amp;amp; Computer Engineering at The University of New Mexico, and received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 1996 from The University of Maryland. David&amp;rsquo;s recent research experiences highlight his ability to bridge the gap between application and computer science. For example, while an NSF CISE Postdoctoral Research Associate in Experimental Computer Science, David worked closely with Earth scientists at NASA/GSFC and University of Maryland&amp;rsquo;s Geography Department to develop a high-performance system for on-demand queries of terascale remotely-sensed Earth science data, such as 4km AVHRR global coverage, used for monitoring long-term global studies of the Earth. In addition to developing some of the fastest known portable, high-performance algorithms for image segmentation and classification applications, combinatorial problems such as sorting and selection, and data communication primitives, David&amp;rsquo;s recent research has produced a new, preliminary methodology for programming UMA shared-memory machines and clusters of SMP nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;biography&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David A. Bader&lt;/strong&gt; holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park. He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Electrical &amp;amp; Computer Engineering Department at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. David completed his B.S. (with high honors) in computer engineering and M.S.E.E. degrees from Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. In support of his doctoral research, David received the presitigous NASA Graduate Student Researcher Fellowship from Goddard Space Flight Center. As an NSF CISE Research Associate in Experimental Computer Science with the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies at the University of Maryland (UMIACS) from 1996-1997, David worked closely with Earth scientists at NASA/GSFC and University of Marylands&amp;rsquo;s Geography Department to develop a high performance system for on-demand queries of terascale remotely-sensed Earth science data, such as 4km AVHRR global coverage, used for monitoring long-term, global studies of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David has published numerous peer-reviewed journal articles in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Parallel &amp;amp; Distributed Computing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;IEEE Transactions on Image Processing&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Journal of Supercomputing&lt;/em&gt;, as well as high performance computing conference papers in the International Parallel Processing Symposium (IPPS) and the Symposium for Praallel Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA). His research interests are in the general area of high performance computing wiht particular emphasis on clustered systems interconnected by high-speed networks, experimental parallel algorithms for data communication, combinatorial and image processing applications, and programming methodologies for clusters of SMP workstations. In addition to the on-demand, remotely-sensed Earth science query system, David has developed other portable high performance applications for image segmentation and classification, and software tools for programming clusters of SMP workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a member of Sigma Xi, Eta Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi, Omicron Delta Kappa, IEEE and ACM.&lt;/p&gt;
