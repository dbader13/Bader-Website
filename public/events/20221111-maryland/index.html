<meta name="description" content="Data science aims to solve grand global challenges such as: detecting and preventing disease in human populations; revealing community structure in large social networks; protecting our elections from cyber-threats, and improving the resilience of the electric power grid.   In this talk, David A. Bader, the 2022 inductee into A. James Clark School of Engineering&#39;s Innovation Hall of Fame at the University of Maryland, will share his passion for solving these global grand challenges. Bader revolutionized the computing industry by architecting the first commodity-based supercomputer using Linux. Today, all the Top 500 supercomputers in the world are Linux HPC systems. His seminal contributions include the first general-purpose programming methodology for multicore clusters and accelerator technologies, such as his pioneering use of the Cell processor and GPUs. Bader is also recognized for his long-standing research efforts on novel parallel and streaming algorithms that have produced multiple “firsts” for graph traversal, search, centrality, and community detection, and many of the best-performing graph algorithms for GPUs.  Bader will present his current research in democratizing data science through the development of this open-source Arkouda framework that supports the productivity of Python and the performance of supercomputers.  Exploratory graph analytics is a much sought out approach to help extract useful information from graphs. One of its main challenges arises when the size of the graph expands outside of the memory capacity that a typical computer can handle. Solutions must then be developed to allow data scientists to efficiently handle and analyze large graphs in a short period of time, using machines that have the capacity to handle massive file sizes. Bader will present the Arachne module for Arkouda with scalable graph algorithms such as breadth-first search, connected components, Jaccard coefficients, truss analytics, triangle counting, and triangle centrality." />

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract" style="text-align: justify;">Data science aims to solve grand global challenges such as: detecting and preventing disease in human populations; revealing community structure in large social networks; protecting our elections from cyber-threats, and improving the resilience of the electric power grid.   In this talk, David A. Bader, the 2022 inductee into A. James Clark School of Engineering&rsquo;s Innovation Hall of Fame at the University of Maryland, will share his passion for solving these global grand challenges. Bader revolutionized the computing industry by architecting the first commodity-based supercomputer using Linux. Today, all the Top 500 supercomputers in the world are Linux HPC systems. His seminal contributions include the first general-purpose programming methodology for multicore clusters and accelerator technologies, such as his pioneering use of the Cell processor and GPUs. Bader is also recognized for his long-standing research efforts on novel parallel and streaming algorithms that have produced multiple “firsts” for graph traversal, search, centrality, and community detection, and many of the best-performing graph algorithms for GPUs.  Bader will present his current research in democratizing data science through the development of this open-source Arkouda framework that supports the productivity of Python and the performance of supercomputers.  Exploratory graph analytics is a much sought out approach to help extract useful information from graphs. One of its main challenges arises when the size of the graph expands outside of the memory capacity that a typical computer can handle. Solutions must then be developed to allow data scientists to efficiently handle and analyze large graphs in a short period of time, using machines that have the capacity to handle massive file sizes. Bader will present the Arachne module for Arkouda with scalable graph algorithms such as breadth-first search, connected components, Jaccard coefficients, truss analytics, triangle counting, and triangle centrality.</p>
