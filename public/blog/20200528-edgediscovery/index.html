      <p>New Jersey Institute of Technology
(NJIT) announced last summer that
the University would establish a new
Institute of Data Science, focusing on
cutting-edge interdisciplinary research
and development in all areas of digital
data. To head up this endeavor,
<strong>Dr. David Bader</strong> joined NJIT as a
Distinguished Professor and Director
of the Institute for Data Science.
Previously serving as the Professor and
Chair of the School of Computational
Science and Engineering at Georgia
Institute of Technology, Bader has
become a leading expert in solving
global grand challenges in science,
engineering, computing, and data
science.</p>
<p>Bader has built important
collaborations across government,
labs, industry, and academia with a
mission of turning ideas into highimpact
technologies that create worldclass
solutions. Partnerships have
included IBM, NVidia, Cray, and Intel,
with government agencies like the
National Science Foundation (NSF),
Department of Defense, Department
of Energy, and the Defense Advance
Research Project Agency (DARPA).
“Data is impacting decisions in
every field, from health care to
finance, arts, entertainment, and
cybersecurity,” says Bader. “I am drawn
to developing research programs in
the emerging area of data science.
At NJIT, we are at the hub of all of
these areas and the Institute for Data
Science brings together faculty from
computing, engineering, business and
management, and science to develop
data-driven technologies.”</p>
<h2 id="a-new-era-of-science">A New Era of Science</h2>
<p>As a graduate student, Bader attended
the University of Maryland and was
awarded the NASA Graduate Student
Researchers Fellowship. Bader’s
mentor from NASA was the late
Jerry Soften, who was NASA&rsquo;s first
astrobiologist and the lead scientist on
the Viking mission to Mars. “Through
this mentorship, I learned a few key
lessons about science,” shares Bader.
“During this time, Soften was pursuing
a new field and pioneering as a
biologist as he looked for life outside
this planet. He had to develop the
science needed for something that
falls outside our typical disciplines. I
have taken that to heart, in that the
most interesting research these days
is at the interface between traditional
academic boundaries.”</p>
<p>Bader says as we move towards
data science, we are looking at
data and the uses and impact of
this information across business
and management, health, financial
services, entertainment, and product
development. “We are entering
into a new era where we must
rethink disciplines and investigate
how machine learning and artificial
intelligence (AI) will further develop
and impact every aspect of our lives.”
With an expansive career of pursuing
highly competitive research, Bader has
managed over eighty projects with an
approximate $185 million worth of
contracts and grants. “I’ve worked with
industry leaders and often provide the
thought leadership for the design of
new algorithms and systems, such as
doing the hardware software co-design
to develop the types of data science
solutions that we will need now and
in the future,” says Bader. “One of the
attractions to research is my desire to
solve real problems and global grand
challenges where the work will have an
impact on people in a way that makes
their lives better or the world a safer
place.”</p>
<h2 id="pioneering-data-analytics">Pioneering Data Analytics</h2>
<p>Bader has had a lifelong interest in
computing and parallel processing
and has worked closely with many
of the parallel computers over the
last several decades. “Throughout
my entire professional career, I have
focused on data-intensive, highperformance
computing applications,”
shares Bader. “I explore how the
architectural designs of today’s
machines are savvier for solving
data science, machine learning, and
AI on massive scale data analytics.”
Bader’s research group has pioneered
high-performance data analytics
for streaming graphs, where they
review real-world observations and
the interactions between them. “We
explore interactions between people,
places, and things,” explains Bader.
“For example, the network traffic
in health care may include patient
records and hospital visits. We take
these irregular, unstructured datasets
with interactions and turn those
relationships into the abstraction of a
graph where the vertices represent the
people, places, and things. The edges
represent the interactions, which
may have, for instance, timestamps,
values, distances, or other attributes,
and through this graph space, we then
reason about the system.”
The research group may also look
at a social network and discover the
emergence of a new community
of interest. “We may examine
the network flow or traffic in an
organization and try to detect a cyber
threat,” says Bader. “Or we may be
working on areas such as tracking
the pandemic spread of disease
and making recommendations on
the best ways to prevent further
contamination.”</p>
<h2 id="the-institute-for-data-science">The Institute for Data Science</h2>
<p>NJIT is making significant investments
in technological research and
development and the Institute for
Data Science directly supports the
University’s strategic initiatives of
driving collaboration within the
thriving tech ecosystem in New Jersey
and surrounding areas. “The Institute
is a research focus at NJIT that brings
together three existing research
centers: one in big data, a second
in medical informatics, and a third
in cybersecurity research,” explains
Bader. “We are planning additional
centers, including AI and machine
learning and data sciences for the
financial services sector. The Institute
dissolves traditional boundaries and
unites faculty, students, and staff
across the entire organization to solve
global grand challenges. To solve these
problems, we need to bring a diverse
set of people together with a variety
of expertise and experience and NJIT
provides a place for this collaboration
in the heart of data science activity.”</p>
<p>In the year ahead, the Institute will
host community workshops and
speakers, including evening classes in
data science for those wishing to gain
more experience. “Recently, we had
Chris Wiggins as a speaker, who is a
professor at Columbia University and
is the Chief Data Scientist of The New
York Times,” says Bader. “We’ve had
speakers from IBM, NVidia, and New
York Presbyterian Hospital to share
their knowledge and expertise, and
we will have a distinguished lecture
in March from Professor Vipin Kumar,
of the University of Minnesota, who is
one of the pioneers in the technique of
data mining and data sciences.”</p>
<p>Bader says we are still at the early
stages of understanding data science,
in terms of the field’s usage and how to
integrate emerging areas like machine
learning and AI. “We are currently at a
very exciting stage in data science and
we must think about data holistically
and how this information integrates
into the world around us. We must
ensure we look at data science not
just as new technology, but explore
how the field can affect our day-to-day
lives.”</p>
<h2 id="connecting-the-community">Connecting the Community</h2>
<p>As a newly minted Research 1
institution, NJIT is at the cusp of
growing their world-class research
mission. Over eight hundred
computing students graduate from
NJIT each year, making the institution
the largest producer of computing
talent in the state. “Our new
designation as an R1 school and the
<em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> ranking us
among the top 100 schools, shows we
are well on our way to being a premier
institution,” says Bader. “Plus, the
establishment of the Institute for Data
Science is recognition of the strong
researchers, faculty, and students
that we have at NJIT and allows the
University to continue to attract,
recruit, and grow as an organization.”</p>
<p>Bader says to further build this
momentum and broaden the impact
of the research community as a
whole, we need to keep developing
consortiums and communication
networks. “In a data-rich environment,
the networks provide the connectivity
of the researchers, the datasets, and
the equipment that is critical to making
progress and achieving success. I look
towards Edge and their establishment
of research networks in New Jersey
for providing a backbone of support,
high-speed data links between our
organizations, and connectivity
across the nation. This network is the
differentiating factor that allows us to
bring together the resources needed
to solve the most data-intensive
applications.”</p>
<p>As the Director, Bader’s vision for the
Institute is to create a collaborative
hub that reaches all of the faculty
and students at NJIT who are using
data in their research, teaching, and
scholarship. “NJIT aims to produce
the skilled career professionals that
are needed in our community. I want
to help solve the problems we face
in Newark and in our surrounding
areas so we have higher-quality lives,
access to better medical care, safer
organizations that are free from
cyberattacks, and better entertainment
systems. For the Institute to be a
success, my goal is to continue to
positively impact the community
that surrounds us at NJIT and make
tangible contributions to the quality of
their lives.”</p>
