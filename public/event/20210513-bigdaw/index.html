<meta name="description" content="A real-world challenge in data science is to develop interactive methods for quickly analyzing new and novel data sets that are potentially of massive scale. In this talk, we discuss our development of suffix array and graph algorithms in the context of Arkouda, a NumPy-like replacement for interactive data science on tens of terabytes of data. Many real-world applications in bioinformatics, web information search and analysis, and lossless compression can be abstracted as string analysis. Suffix arrays are a very efficient data structure to support quick search of any string patterns. We have integrated the suffix array data structure (including its enhanced Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array) and the corresponding construction algorithm into Arkouda, thus providing Python users with a powerful method to support different types of string analysis.  Our novel approach integrates a suffix array algorithm library into Arkouda so that the Arkouda runtime can select the large suffix array construction algorithm dynamically based on the dataset properties. Two of the implemented methods on the back-end of Arkouda include our novel O(n) time complexity skew algorithm in Chapel, and the DivSufSoft suffix array construction algorithm in C, which has higher time complexity but often is faster in practice.  Experimental results show that, supported by Arkouda, Python users can build a large scale string’s suffix array and LCP array in a Jupyter notebook easily without losing any performance compared with the directly back-end operation. Our future work is extending our self-developed algorithm to support multi-locale parallel execution, so that our algorithm can handle large strings on distributed systems. Graphs are widely used to abstract problems in domains such as social sciences, biological systems, and information systems.  To support real-world large graph analysis in Arkouda, we first developed the array-based graph data structure which can be used like an adjacency matrix or incidence matrix but with much less memory. At the same time, it naturally works well with Arkouda’s array operators. Based on this succinct graph data structure, we have developed two typical graph algorithms, breadth-first search (BFS) and triangle counting. Both algorithms have been successfully integrated into Arkouda. Both are multi-locale algorithms so they can handle a very large graph on distributed systems. Experimental results of BFS on a 32-node cluster system show that our method can build large graphs into distributed memory and execute the parallel BFS algorithm on typical sparse graph benchmarks and R- MAT generator-based graphs successfully. The performance results show that the distributed graph building time and BFS time will increase linearly with the total number of edges. For future work, we will further optimize these graph algorithms and investigate the streaming versions in Arkouda.
