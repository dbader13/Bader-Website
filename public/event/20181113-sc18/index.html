      <p class="pub-abstract">Government agencies and a variety of institutions from disparate areas (finance, healthcare, insurance, tele-communication, computing, etc.) have recognized the necessity of a new generation of systems and tools targeted at efficiently solving large scale graph and combinatorial problems. While infrastructures like GraphLab, GraphX (on top of Spark), Pregel, Giraph, and, in general, vertex or edge-centric approaches based on MapReduce-like data-parallel models have started to provide valuable results and found rapid adoption also on distributed memory systems, thanks to their higher-level programming abstractions, they have not yet demonstrated the ability to significantly scale the size of the problems addressed while maintaining nearly constant throughput as more computational elements are added. However, systems targeted at identifying threats to national security, as well as at data mining for commercial applications, are required to provide insights in actionable timeframes. Computing infrastructures targeted at solving scientific problems need to organize, filter, and process efficiently the increasing amount of scientific data (provided, for example, by more precise acquisition systems) at performance levels that could significantly extend the scope of the analyses (e.g., increasing the number of computational simulations). A new set of requirements, such as the support for streaming graphs and the ability to deal with attributed graphs are emerging.
